    <h1>What Are Bearded Dragons?</h1>

    <p>Bearded Dragons (AKA Pogona Vitticeps) are reptiles that originate from the deserts of Australia.
        Bearded Dragons are cold blooded, which is why it is very important that they have proper lighting fixtures in their enclosure!</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <h4>Interesting facts about Bearded Dragons:</h4>
        <li>They can grow up to 24 inches long!</li>  
        <li>They make a great pet because of how affectionate and curious they are (mine will snuggle and watch movies with me!)</li>
       <li>In the winter some Bearded Dragons go into a type of hibernation called Bromation.</li>
        <li>Bearded Dragons lay eggs! So if you see eggs in your tank, it's a female!</li>
        <li>Beardies have spikes along their face and body. When they are afraid or need to defend themselves they will
        puff out thier beard until it becomes big and black, they will also flatten their body so they look bigger and their 
        spikes are more pronouced. If your Beardie is displaying a black beard they may be anxious or scared, so try and 
        figure out what may be wrong with them!</li>
        <li> Beardies require fruits and vegatables along with protein, such as Meal Worms, Dubia Roaches and Cockraoches for their diet.</li>
        <li>MAKE SURE YOU RESEARCH WHAT FRUTIS AND VEGGIES YOUR BEARDIE CAN EAT!!! There are some that are harmful to them.</li>
